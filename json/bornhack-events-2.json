          "description": "The talk will be about the live art instrument `niseq`\\, which stands for 'the n-dimensional image-sequencer'. It will revolve around the foundational ideas of why `niseq` is relevant as a tool for making art\\, the design of the instrument from an artists perspective - and around the technical aspects of the construction of the software in the functional language OCaml.\\n\\nMost of film-art made today is centered around a narrative structure - where the relevance of the film-medium has gone into the background\\, and has more become a fast-food alternative to books. Early film-experiments done by the dadaists and surrealists see so much more potential in the medium than what it has become today. `niseq` can be seen as 'going back to the roots' of early 1920's cinema\\, but at the same time bringing live art to the film-medium\\, as e.g. seen in modern electronic art made with modular synthesizers. \\n\\nThe software relies on modern graphics-cards and SSD's\\, and enables 60fps random-access to any video-frame of precompiled video-footage. This design enables a lot of creative constructs to be built on top. The reactive semantics of the instrument is entirely programmed using 'functional reactive programming'\\, which both enables efficiency\\, safety and declaration of time-semantics in a simple way. This structuring methodology is combined with OCamls 'first class modules' to enable a declarative functional variant of 'stateful objects'.",

In 2011 Wietse Venema discovered a flaw in Postfix that allowed a man in the middle attacker to inject commands into an encrypted connection [1].\\n\\nWe discovered that the flaw is still widely present in E-Mail servers and also\\, previously unknown\\, the same flaw exists in many mail clients. In some cases these flaws allow stealing E-Mail credentials. Furthermore the STARTTLS mechanism is weakly specified and in part contradictory\\, which allows other attacks.\\n\\nThe talk will give an overview on why STARTTLS is dangerous and should be avoided.",

When they created Dynamics Multimedia\\, their fourth brother Gaby joined. Gaby was a football enthusiast and the four\\, together with Carlos Abril and Pedro Sudn\\, were able to create the most successful PC gaming series of all time in Spain's history: PC Ftbol\\, with more than 1.560.000 magazines (*) sold. This success was not only limited to Spain\\, as the game was exported to Italy (PC Calcio)\\, Argentina (PC Apertura/Clausura) and UK (PC Premier/Premier Manager 97 and 99).\\n\\nTwo years ago\\, it was the 25th anniversary of the first edition of the PC Ftbol game and thanks to Wine I was able to install it on my *nix box. I learned that there existed a Community that tried to keep the game up-to-date with the newest players and teams +25 years later. I also noticed that it takes a lot of effort from the Community to do this\\, as it's mostly a manual process when editing data in (encoded) binary format. Users have stated on PCFutbolMania.com that it takes about a day to update a team. Since the games have around +480 teams\\, this can be a tedious and time consuming process.\\n\\nIn this talk I will showcase how i have been able to create some tools that will ease data updates of these awesome games in an almost no time and letting the computer do all the work.\\n\\n(*) - Come by and learn why I state magazines and not units or copies of the game.",

          "description": "Hi\\, my name is Dani and I do maths (data scientist). I understand the world with equations and I cant tell when people lie to me. Being able to read people and tell them what they want to hear is an essential skill if you want to go up on the corporate ladder - lack this skill.\\n\\nHaving been told many times that I am too technical to get promoted\\, I used my technical skills to delve into corporate politics. Large corporations comprise different teams working on the same goals: project delivery and reaching the financial target. Each team comprises members that work towards this goal\\, but also have a selfish motivation: to get promoted and achieve a higher position on the hierarchy. If a team in a corporation is equated to a system and the members of staff are assumed to be agents then game theory can be applied to investigate the rate at which the performance of the team -and therefore the quality of project delivery- will degrade due to the\\nselfish behaviour of the team members. This can be measured using the Price of Anarchy.\\n\\nI will talk about the application of game theory in ethics and the challenges arising from this approach\\, followed by a description of the Prisoners dilemma and its application in behavioural metrics. The Price of Anarchy (PoA) will then be defined followed by the presentation of the selfish routing and of different types of the PoA depending on the equilibria and the information achieved. I will also talk about prediction models and outcomes based on this approach. Finally\\, the potential application of the PoA approach in corporate environments will be discussed.\\n\\nI aim to explain game theory while addressing the frustration that some corporate behaviours are causing to creative people and/or people that think out of the box in a fun and approachable way. I hope that at the end of this talk people will feel more confident with game theory and will understand that they are not alone when facing workplace politics.",
